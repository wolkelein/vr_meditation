# HUSH

## What is hush?
Hush is first and foremost a meditation. To make the viewer more present in the meditation it deviates from the classical audio platform to a virtual reality platform. Particularly, it is a meditation that can be experienced just with an android phone and a Google Cardboard VR Viewer. You can choose from two different meditation scenes (Ocean and Garden), various background audio, as well as set the daytime and the voice for the meditation audio.

## How was it made?
Hush was made in Unity 2023.3.23f1. It makes use of the Google Cardboard XR Plugin (https://developers.google.com/cardboard/develop/unity/quickstart) as well as the Oculus Voice SDK (https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/voice-sdk-overview/).
